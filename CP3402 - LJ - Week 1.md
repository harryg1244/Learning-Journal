I spent about 5 hours of my own time this week on this subject, not including time I spent on the assignment.

Content Insights
	
Once installing Visual Studio Code, I initially started my website from scratch re-learning the basics. I did not use any format or template for the initial design. I just wanted to see what I could make of my previous knowledge. I will transition into using frameworks to ensure clean and efficient code.
I re-learned that HTML is responsible for a website's structure and content, while CSS handles its design and appearance. I learned about a lot of the CSS formatting and experimented with all sorts of design choices. 
I looked into how frameworks like Bootstrap can speed up the design process by providing pre-built components and layouts.
I also learnt about Git hosting for the first time.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
While I didn’t explore any specific learning resources this week, I did turn to certain forums, websites, and Visual Studio Code AI for assistance and re-learning.
I like my learning style of trying things hands-on first. Once I believe I’m finished, or reach a point where I feel stuck, I then view more in-depth tutorials. I feel this works best for me and is what feels most natural/comfortable. This lets me learn through trial and error while also reinforcing my understanding through guides when needed.
