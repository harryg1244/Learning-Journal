# CP3402 Learning Journal - Harrison Groemer

**Week 1:**

## Learning Activities & Resources:

- I did not attend the weekly Seminar, although I did engage with forums for expert advice and assistance. I also followed the tutorials provided for the installation of Visual Code Studio and the set up of Git hosting.

## Estimated Hours: 5 hours  

- I spent about 5 hours of my own time this week on this subject, not including time spent on the assignment.

## Content Insights

- After installing Visual Studio Code, I started my website from scratch, re-learning the basics. I chose not to use any format or template for the initial design, instead experimenting with what I could create from my previous knowledge.  
- My plan is to transition into using frameworks to ensure clean and efficient code.
- I re-learned that **HTML** is responsible for a website's structure and content, while **CSS** handles its design and appearance. I experimented with various CSS formatting options and design choices.
- I explored how frameworks like **Bootstrap** can speed up the design process by providing pre-built components and layouts.
- I also learned about **Git hosting** for the first time.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

- While I didn’t explore any specific learning resources this week, I did turn to certain forums, websites, and **Visual Studio Code AI** for assistance and re-learning.
- I prefer my learning style of trying things hands-on first. Once I believe I’m finished or reach a point where I feel stuck, I then look at more in-depth tutorials. This works best for me, as it allows me to learn through trial and error while reinforcing my understanding through guides when needed.
